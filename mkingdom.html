    <h1>Mkingdom Lab Write-Up</h1>
    <p><strong>Lab Name:</strong> Mkingdom</p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To gain root access</p>
    <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> pspy64, ffuf, nmap</p>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Initial Access and Enumeration</h3>
    <p>I first tried accessing the IP through the browser and failed. Then I ran an nmap command similar to:</p>
    <pre><code>sudo nmap &lt;ip&gt; -sSCV</code></pre>
    <p>Then I saw that the port was 85. I connected to port 85 and succeeded in accessing the lab. I started fuzzing all the directories and found an interesting directory called <code>app</code>. I navigated there and was redirected to the castle, which was a demo blog website running Concrete5. I found the version in a .json file and checked it in the browser. I discovered it was reported on HackerOne.</p>
    <p>There was a login panel for admin. I used 'admin' as both username and password and gained access. I followed the report’s instructions, uploaded a reverse shell, and connected through <code>nc</code>. I was now in the shell.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Privilege Escalation</h3>
    <p>Once I had access, I searched for credentials for <code>toad</code> and <code>mario</code>, as I couldn’t access their files. I went to <code>/var/www/html</code> and searched for databases. After finding a useful database, I ran:</p>
    <pre><code>cat whatever/whatever | grep password</code></pre>
    <p>This allowed me to obtain <code>toad</code>'s password. I then accessed <code>toad</code>'s files and used:</p>
    <pre><code>env</code></pre>
    <p>to find <code>mario</code>'s password, which was base64 encoded. I decoded it, logged in as <code>mario</code>, and accessed his folder. I found <code>user.txt</code> but couldn't <code>cat</code> it, so I used <code>head</code> or <code>strings</code> to read it. I submitted the flag but tried different methods that failed.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Final Exploitation and Root Access</h3>
    <p>I hosted a server with pspy64 and transferred it to the victim server using <code>wget</code>. Running pspy64 revealed that the server was downloading <code>config.sh</code> from a specific path. I used <code>sed</code> to modify the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. I copied it to <code>mario</code>'s folder, changed it with <code>sed</code>, and copied it back to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. I updated the IP of <code>mkingdom.thm</code> to point to my server and created the necessary folder structure.</p>
    <p>I hosted a Python server with a script:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
chmod u+s /bin/bash</code></pre>
    <p>When the victim server tried to access <code>config.sh</code>, it executed my script with root privileges. I then accessed the victim server and ran:</p>
    <pre><code>/bin/bash</code></pre>
    <p>I navigated to the root folder, found the <code>root.txt</code> file, and submitted it. <strong>BOOM!</strong></p>
