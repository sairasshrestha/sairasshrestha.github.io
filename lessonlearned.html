    <h1>üü¢ SQL Injection Lab: Bypassing the Login</h1>

    <h3><strong>Lab Name:</strong> Lesson learned?</h3>
    <h3><strong>Goal:</strong> To bypass login</h3>
    <h3><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Burpsuite and some brainpower</h3>
    <h3><strong>Type:</strong> SQL Injection (#sqli)</h3>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute-forcing Username</h3>
    <p>The first thing I did when I saw the login page was to brute-force the login, so I sent the request to the repeater and tried entering incorrect credentials around 10-20 times. Since I wasn‚Äôt getting any pushback, I decided to brute-force common usernames.</p>
    <p>Initially, I used the default system usernames file from <strong>Seclists</strong>, but that didn‚Äôt work out. I then switched to more common names, and soon enough, I found a valid username!</p>

    <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Trying SQLi for the Password</h3>
    <p>Now, I was ready to brute-force the password too, but then I thought, ‚ÄúWait a second, what about SQL injection?‚Äù</p>
    <p>I sent the correct username along with a few SQLi attempts in the password field, but no luck at first. Then, I tried a very simple SQLi payload in the <strong>username</strong> field instead of the password.</p>

    <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Cracking the Lab</h3>
    <p>Are you still here? Maybe you're a beginner, and that‚Äôs cool. But if you already know SQL injection and you're here without trying first... shame on you! üòâ</p>
    <p>Here‚Äôs the payload that worked for me:</p>
    <p class="invisible-text">username=arnold'--+&password=</p>

    <h2>Additionally, a Lesson Learned:</h2>
    <div class="code-block">
        <p>Using <strong>OR 1=1</strong> is risky and should rarely be used in real world engagements. Since it loads all rows of the table, it may not even bypass the login, if the login expects only 1 row to be returned. Loading all rows of a table can also cause performance issues on the database. However, the real danger of <strong>OR 1=1</strong> is when it ends up in either an UPDATE or DELETE statement, since it will cause the modification or deletion of every row.</p>
        
        <p>For example, consider that after logging a user in, the application re-uses the username input to update a user's login status: <strong>UPDATE users SET online=1 WHERE username='&lt;username&gt;';</strong></p>

        <p>A successful injection of <strong>OR 1=1</strong> here would cause every user to appear online. A similar DELETE statement, possibly to delete prior session data, could wipe session data for all users of the application.</p>

        <p>Consider using <strong>AND 1=1</strong> as an alternative, with a valid input (in this case a valid username) to test/confirm SQL injection.</p>
