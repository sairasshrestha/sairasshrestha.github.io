    <h1>Cyberlens Lab Write-Up</h1>
    <p>It was more difficult than the mkingdom since I don't know much about Windows, but here I am after completing itâ€”so yeah, nothing's impossible!</p>

    <h2>Lab Name:</h2>
    <p><strong>Cyberlens</strong></p>

    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p><strong>To gain root access</strong></p>

    <h2>Tools Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Metasploit</li>
        <li>ffuf</li>
        <li>nmap</li>
        <li>searchsploit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <h3>1. Initial Exploration:</h3>
        <p>The first thing I did was use <code>nmap</code> on the target IP to see which ports were open. Then I used <code>ffuf</code> to fuzz the directories. I checked port 80 by simply searching the IP in a web browser, and yes, it was available.</p>
        <p>I took a closer look at the website and noticed that it was fetching data from another port. I accessed this port and discovered it was running a deprecated version of Apache Tika.</p>
        <p>I searched for this vulnerability on <code>searchsploit</code> and found a corresponding exploit in <code>Metasploit</code>. I set up the exploit with all the necessary options and hit <code>exploit</code>. Success! I got a shell.</p>
        <p>I navigated through the system and found the <code>user.txt</code> file at <code>/user/Iforgotthenamebutit'snotadministrator/Desktop/user.txt</code>.</p>

        <h3>2. Privilege Escalation:</h3>
        <p>I saved the session by pressing <code>Ctrl+Z</code>, then searched for the <code>post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester</code> exploit in Metasploit. I set the session and ran it, which found a working vulnerability.</p>
        <p>I used this exploit, set the options, and ran it. Boom! I gained admin privileges and accessed the <code>/Users/Administrator/Desktop/admin.txt</code> file.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p><strong>BOOM!</strong> Another challenge conquered. Cyberlens proved to be a tough nut to crack, but perseverance and the right tools made it possible. Onward to the next!</p>
